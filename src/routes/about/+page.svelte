		<p class="mt-4">When someone wants to improve at GeoGuessr, they often try to memorize lists of bollards, signs,
			Google cars, and other clues. This can be quite overwhelming because there are so many different details to
			remember. I tried teaching my friends some of these "metas" by playing the world map with them and pointing out
			specific clues, but by the time those clues appeared again, they had already forgotten them. To help with this, I
			created a map highlighting the most common "metas" - anything from landscapes, bollards, and signs to unique
			Google Street View cars that are useful to learn at the beginning.</p>
		<p class="mt-4 mb-4">While there might be other maps like this available, mine includes a Google Sheet that explains each round and
			highlights the clues you might have missed that could help you identify the country. You can simply post the
			location link in the google sheet, and it will tell you what you missed, or you can use a script that shows a note
			about the location after you make your guess in GeoGuessr.
			The map is designed for No Move/NMPZ (for the rounds with google car meta will be harder because it won't be fully
			visible but, itâ€™s easily doable).
